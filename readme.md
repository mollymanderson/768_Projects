# About me

Hi folks! My name is Molly Anderson, and I'm in my final semester in the Information School at UW-Madison. During my time in the program, my concentration has been in Academic Librarianship, and I am especially interested in engaging in reference and instruction work as a future professional in the field. Prior to beginning the MA in Library and Information Studies in Madison, I graduated from the University of North Dakota with degrees in English, History, and Honors, so I especially enjoying helping patrons with queries in these areas!
